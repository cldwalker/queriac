<h1>Tutorial</h1>
<h2>Some commands to get you started.</h2>
<p>
	When you created your Queriac account a few commands were generated for you automatically.
	Among the more obvious starter commands like a Google quicksearch, there are some commands that give you
	quick access to various parts of your account. Once you've got your browser set up per the above instructions, 
	type any of the following right into your address bar..
</p>

<p class="caption">&rarr; Type <code>q</code> in the address bar and you'll be taken to your Queriac account page.</p>

<p class="caption">&rarr; Type <code>new</code> in the address bar and you'll be taken to Queriac's "Create a New Command" page.</p>

<p class="caption">&rarr; Type <code>show g</code> to view a command's summary page (g for Google Quicksearch in this case), showing you its tags, a list of recent queries you've made with the command, etc.</p>

<p class="caption">&rarr; Type <code>edit g</code> to edit a command. (again, g as in Google Quicksearch in this example)</p>

	<h2>Using Bookmarklets</h2>
	<p>If you want to use bookmarklets through Queriac, you'll need to add the following bookmarklet to your local
		bookmarks in your browser. Because of Javascript's client-side nature (see <%= link_to "Same Origin Policy", "http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/same-origin.html" %>), this bookmarklet is needed to download 
		the Javascript source from your Queriac commands and it evaluates it locally.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>To install:</b> Right-click on the link below and save it as a local bookmakrk. You'll need to give it a keyword 
		(or shortcut in Camino).. something like <code>j</code>. If you don't see the keyword/shortcut column in
		your browser's bookmarks window, you'll need to enable it by clicking the little dropdown doohicky on the right
		side of the column header.
	</p>
	<p class="bordered">
		Right-click to install: <a href="javascript:_s=document.createElement('script');_s.type='text/javascript';_s.src='http://queri.ac/<%= current_user.login %>/%s?js=1';document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(_s);void(0);">Queriac Bookmarklet Enabler</a>
